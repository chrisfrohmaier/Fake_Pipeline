This is the first working version of the SNe Pipeline for adding fakes to galaxies in the PTF Pipeline.

It does not yet have the 40 mask area around each fake.

NEED TO ADD:

-Somewhere to save the background level before the fake is in serted
-Noise in the background

-Record Fluxes
	-At pixel where fake is added
	-3x3 grid around pixel 
	-5x5 grid
	-7x7

-Would like to do photometry where the star is placed, but before the star is placed there.
